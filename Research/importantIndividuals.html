			<h2>European</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h3>Alfred of Sareshel</h3>
					<p>Translated the <i></i>Kitab ash-Shifa</i> from Avicenna(Ibn Sina), and inserted it into the Aristotlian <i>Meteors'</i> fourth book [1]</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Petrus Bonus of Ferrara</h3>
					<p>Writer of the <i>Magarita pretiosa</i></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Robert of Chester</h3>
					<p>Translated the <i>Masa il Khalid li-Maryanus al-rahib</i> into Latin (<i>Liber de compositione alchemiae</i>)</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Morienus</h3>
					<p>Also known as:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Maryanos
						</li>
						<li>
							Marianos
						</li>
						<li>
							Maryanus
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Morienus is a potentially fictional Byzantine monk, and student of Stephanus of Alexandria. Morienus is the other party in the <i>Liber de compositione alchemiae</i>
					</p>

			<h2>Greek</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h3>Aristotle</h3>
					<p>Aristotle is arguably the backbone of 13th century Alchemy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelianism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aristotelianism</a> and Aristotle's various books form the foundation for Natural Philosophy.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Hermes Trismegistus</h3>
					<p>Mercurius ter Maximus is a likely fictional, or at the very least, highly exaggerated, alchemist, who is the origin of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeticism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hermeticism</a>. Hermes Trismegistus was thought to be a combination of Hermes and Thoth. Similar to Geber, Hermes Trismegistus was a common pseudepigraph.</p>
					<p>Hermes Trismegistus is attributed to many books, including a <i>Liber Hermetis</i> which was unlabeled and included into the <i>Interrogations and Responses</i> of the <i>Liber de compositione alchemiae</i> by a scribe. The <i>Magarita pretiosa</i> cites this <i>Liber Hermetis</i> believing it to from Morienus.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Arabic</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h3>Ibn Sina</h3>
					<p>Avicenna, in the text inserted into <i>Meteors</i>, supports <a href="Topics/mercuryTheory.html">mercury theory</a>, however actively denounces transmutation. Because this idea was connected to Aristotle, and the weight his texts had in the alchemical community, this would later cause many issues.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Jabir ibn Hayyan</h3>
					<p>Geber is a (potentially non-existent) Islamic alchemist whose name has been used *extensively* by many alchemists as a pseudepigraph. There are many works written solely in Latin, which are known to not belong to Jabir ibn Hayyan. However, there is also evidence that suggests that even the Arabic works attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan may haven been produced by Arabic students using the name for authority.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Khalid ibn Yazid</h3>
					<p>Calid was a prince (and then king) of Umayyad. The <i>Masa il Khalid li-Maryanus al rahib</i> is attributed to him, although this is debated.</p>
