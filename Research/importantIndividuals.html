					<h3>Alfred of Sareshel</h3>
					<p>Translated the <i></i>Kitab ash-Shifa</i> from Avicenna(Ibn Sina), and inserted it into the Aristotlian <i>Meteors'</i> fourth book [1]</p>

					<h3>Aristotle</h3>
					<p>Aristotle is arguably the backbone of 13th century Alchemy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelianism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aristotelianism</a> and Aristotle's various books form the foundation for Natural Philosophy.</p>

					<h3>Ibn Sina</h3>
					<p>Avicenna, in the text inserted into <i>Meteors</i>, supports <a href="Topics/mercuryTheory.html">mercury theory</a>, however actively denounces transmutation. Because this idea was connected to Aristotle, and the weight his texts had in the alchemical community, this would later cause many issues.</p>

				<li>
					<h3>Jabir ibn Hayyan</h3>
					<p>Geber is a (potentially non-existent) Islamic alchemist whose name has been used *extensively* by many alchemists as a pseudepigraph. There are many works written solely in Latin, which are known to not belong to Jabir ibn Hayyan. However, there is also evidence that suggests that even the Arabic works attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan may haven been produced by Arabic students using the name for authority.</p>
