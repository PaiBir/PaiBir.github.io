					<h3>Albertus Magnus</h3>
					<p>
						Writer of the <i>De Mineralibus</i>
					</p>
					<p>Disagreed heavilly with the "Callisthenes" (Khalid) view of all metals being various states of completion of gold, due to their stability.</p>
					<p>Disagrees with Sciant Artifices, by interpreting species as "Specific Form"</p>

						<h4>Excerpt from the <i>De Mineralibus</i><a href="references.html">[1]</a></h4>

							Alchemy proceeds through this method, namely by corrupting one &lt;metal&gt; through a removal &lt;of it&gt; from its own species, and by inducing the species of another with the aid of those &lt;natures&gt; that are in matter...for in these &lt;sulfur and mercury&gt; the species of every metal are induced...
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>A breakdown:</h4>
						<p>
							According to Albertus, a metal can be transmuted not through direct transmutation, but by taking it the long way around. Albertus suggests that by removing its defining characteristics, its species can be removed. And then by introducing another set of characteristics from another species, let nature turn that formless material into another species.
						</p>
						<p>
							As Newman points out, by replacing species with "specific form", Albertus sidesteps Sciant Artifeces, and pulls on established literature on physical corruption of a form, with a subsequent transformation into another form. This is, in and of itself, a corruption and subsequent transformation of the "species" used in <i>De Congelatione</i>, which Avicenna originally used as a "logical entity", similar the use of <i>genus</i> by logicians.[1]
						</p>
						<p>
							However, the important detail which distinguishes the Albertian view of Alchemy from the Paulian lies in methodology. Albertian alchemy mimics nature, with a rather mystical outlook on the world (fire mimicing stars, and alchemical instruments mimicing the caverns where metals grow). Paulian alchemy, as we will see later, is not quite as whimisical.<br>
							As such, Albertian alchemy is likely better for my setting, as this produces, in my estimation, richer worldbuilding potential.

					<h3>Roger Bacon</h3>
					<p>
						Writer of the <i>Opus Minus</i> and <i>Opus Tertium</i>. An excitable friar who was prone to hyperbole.

						<h4>Excerpt from the <i>Opus Tertium</i><a href="references.html">[1]</a></h4>

							But there is another science which is about the generation of things from the elements, and about all inanimate things, for example the elements, simple and compounded humors, common stones, gems, and types of marble, gold, and other metals, sulfurs, salts, and inks, azures, minium, and other colors, oils and burning pitches, and countless other things of which we have nothing in the books of Aristotle: nor do natural philosophers know of these things, nor the whole Latin crowd. And since this science is ignored by the mass of students, it is necessary that they be ignroant of all natural things that follow therefrom, for example the generation of animated things, such as vegetables, animals, and men, for prior things having been ignored, it is necessary that posterior things be ignored... Whence, due to ignorance of this science, common natural consequently, practical medicine, not only because natural philosophy and theoretical medicine are necessary for its practice, but because all simple medicines from inanimate things are recieved from this science... Nor can the names of medicins or their significations be known without this science. And this science is called "theoretical alchemy," which theorizes about all inanimate things and about the generation of things from the elements. There is in adition an operative and practical alchemy, which teaches how to make noble metals, colors, and many other things - better and more plentifully by art than they are produced by nature.  And a science of this sort is greater than all the preceding, because it produces greater utility. Not only can it provide the expenditures and countless other &lt;needs&gt; of the republic, but it teaches how to discover such things as can greatly prolong human life, which cannot be arrived at by nature.

					<h3>Paulus of Taranto</h3>
					<p>Alternatives to Taranto:</p>

						<li><p>Toronto</p></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Wrote the <i><a href="Texts/summaPerfectionis.html">Summa Perfectionis</a></i> and <i>Theorica et practica</i></p>
					<p>Paulian alchemy splits the Art into two genera. The first of these is the basal elements, while the second is accidental properties. Paulian alchemy believes the second genus to be what Aristotle refers to as the art which cannot surpass nature. By essence of acting on purely sensory properties, is "not transmutative of substance". The first genus, however, can influence nature to enact change.</p>

							Art exists solely in the role of mover and director, of supporter and uler, but not in the role of maker. Nature herself is then in the role of mover, maker, or causer...

			<h2>Greek</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h3>Aristotle</h3>
					<p>Aristotle is arguably the backbone of 13th century Alchemy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelianism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aristotelianism</a> and Aristotle's various books form the foundation for Natural Philosophy.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Hermes Trismegistus</h3>
					<p>Mercurius ter Maximus is a likely fictional, or at the very least, highly exaggerated, alchemist, who is the origin of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeticism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hermeticism</a>. Hermes Trismegistus was thought to be a combination of Hermes and Thoth. Similar to Geber, Hermes Trismegistus was a common pseudepigraph.</p>
					<p>Hermes Trismegistus is attributed to many books, including a <i>Liber Hermetis</i> which was unlabeled and included into the <i>Interrogations and Responses</i> of the <i>Liber de compositione alchemiae</i> by a scribe. The <i>Magarita pretiosa</i> cites this <i>Liber Hermetis</i> believing it to from Morienus.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Arabic</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h3>Ibn Sina</h3>
					<p>Avicenna, in the text inserted into <i>Meteors</i>, supports <a href="Topics/mercuryTheory.html">mercury theory</a>, however actively denounces transmutation. Because this idea was connected to Aristotle, and the weight his texts had in the alchemical community, this would later cause many issues.</p>
					<section class="Species">
						<p>Avicennian species are, as described by Newman, abstract categories beyond mortal comprehension. Transmutation of such species would constitute humans having the ability to overcome God's will, and reform what he made. This makes Avicennian species more concrete than Albertian species. Depending on which species you prefer, the malleability of the natural world is either quite low, or extremely high.</p>

					<h3>Jabir ibn Hayyan</h3>
					<p>Geber is a (potentially non-existent) Islamic alchemist whose name has been used *extensively* by many alchemists as a pseudepigraph. There are many works written solely in Latin, which are known to not belong to Jabir ibn Hayyan. However, there is also evidence that suggests that even the Arabic works attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan may haven been produced by Arabic students using the name for authority.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Khalid ibn Yazid</h3>
					<p>Calid was a prince (and then king) of Umayyad. The <i>Masa il Khalid li-Maryanus al rahib</i> is attributed to him, although this is debated. Additionally, a psuedo-Khalid ibn Yazid is the ascribed author of the <i>Liber trium verborum</i></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Abu Bakr al-Razi</h3>
					<p>Physician, Philosopher, and Alchemsit. Credited with the <i>De aluminibus et salibus</i>, however that seems to have been made by a Psuedo-Razi. Also known as Rhazes, or Rhasis</p>
