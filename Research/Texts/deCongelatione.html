				Artificers produce a solidification quite similar &lt;to that of the metals&gt; artificially, although artificial things are not like natural ones, nor so certain, even hough they may be likenesses. Hence it is believed that natural composition comes about in this way or in a way similar to this. But art is weaker than nature and does not equalit, however much it labor. Whence the artificers of alchemy should know that the species of the metals cannot be transmuted. They can however make likenesses and tint red with yellow, so that it seem gold, and tint white with whatever color they want, until it be very similar to gold or copper. They can also remove the dirtiness of lead, but it will alwas be lead. Although it may seem silver, yet other qualities will obtain in it, so that men err in this, such as those who take salt and sal ammoniac. In addition, I do not believe that the specific &lt;i.e. species - determining.&gt; difference may be removed by any ingenious technique, because it is not due to such that one complexion is changed to another, since these sensible things are not &lt;those&gt; by which species are mutated, but are accidents and properties. For the &lt;specific&gt; differences of the metals are not known, and since the difference is not known, how will it be possible to know whether it is taken awat or not, or how it could be taken away? But the stripping off of accidents within, such as taste, color, weight, or at least their diminution, is not impossible, for there is no argument against this. In addition, the proportion of composition of these substances will not be the same in all. Therefore one composite will not be able to be transmuted into the other unless perhaps it be reduced into the prime matter and thus be permuted into something other than what it was before. But this does not occur by means of liquefaction alone; rather, certain extraneous things befall it as a result of this.</to>

				My notes:

			<p>
				Avicenna's opinion here is correct, but for the wrong reasons. Newman proposes that this lack of faith in transmutation may be due to local alchemists producing fraudulent wares that could not withstand testing. I am inclined to agree with this conclusion, especially when thinking of texts such as the <a href="papyri.html">Leyden and Stockholm Papyri</a>. Note how quickly the Leyden Papyrus X talks about falsification of gold, and the Stockholm Papyrus is full of recipies proporting the difficulty of revealing the subterfuge of the recpie. If this was the mindset that Ibn Sina saw in local alchemists, or even in the recipies he had access to, I imagine that it would be easy for him to become dissolutioned to the Art. From there, it is not a far step to take a view which could be seen as 'anti-technology'.
