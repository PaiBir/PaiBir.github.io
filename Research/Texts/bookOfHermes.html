						Metallic bodies, inasmuch as they are works of nature, are natural, but human works are artificial and not natural.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Likewise the components of the respective metals are determinate according to their quantity, which quantity is unknown to mortals. Hence the latter cannot fabricate the former.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Likewise the place of their generation is the center of the earth, just as the fetus is not generated except in an animals womb, so metals are not &lt;generated&gt; except in the center of the earth.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Likewise metals have a determinate time in which they must be generated, but that &lt;time&gt; is unknown to men. Therefore men do not know how to make them.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Likewise metals differ in species. Hence in the same way that an ass is not generated from a man, metals are not generated from different metals.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Likewise it happens that &lt;alchemists&gt; transmute their colors, but fire dissolves these transmutations. Therefore they are transmuted in vain.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Likewise philosophers, if they knew this art to be true as other arts are, would have taught it as other arts.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Likewise, the followers of &lt;this art&gt; have no certain authority, but only old papers and glib fables, for example, "a certain man related to me, 'take such and such, and such to such, and such will be produed from such.'"
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Likewise, if this art were true, it would not have been hidden to such a degree, especially having ben sought for so long with so great intent.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>&lt;Responses&gt;</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						But human works are variously the same as natural ones, as we will show in fire, air, water, earth, minerals, trees, and animals. For the fire of natural lightning and the fire thrown forth by a stone is the same fire. The natural ambient air and the artificial air produced by boiling are both air. The nautral earth beneath our feet an the artificial earth produced by letting water sit are both earth. Green salt, vitriol, tutia, and sal ammoniac are both artificial and natural. But the artificial are even better than the natural, which &lt;anyone&gt; who knows about minerals does not contradict. The natural wild tree and the artificial&lt;ly&gt; grafted one are both trees. Natural bees and artificial bees generated from a &lt;decomposing&gt; bull are both bees. Nor does art do all these things; rather it helps nature do them. Therefore the assistance of this art does not alter the nature of things. Hence the works of man can be both natural with regard to essence and artificial with regard to mode of production.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The argument concerning the quantity of components is refuted by the green salt and other products mentioned above, which we make unremittingly without determination of the quantity of components.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The argument concerning place &lt;of generation&gt; is annulled because just as an animal is born from an egg in the womb &lt;of its mother&gt;, so &lt;if the egg&gt; is put under a breast or in a ripening chamber, the animal will be born.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The forsaid objection based on time &lt;of generation&gt; is easily crippled in the same way as that concerning the quantity of components.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Concerning differences of species, there is the objection that metals do not differ in species and &lt;to the contrary&gt; agree in one definition, for example, "composite body fusible in fire, not combustible, &lt;and&gt; extensible under the hammer." But let me acknowledge that practically no &lt;others&gt; are similar to these,&lt;which are&gt; similar &lt;to each other&gt;, because one &lt;metal&gt; recieves the other, and they suffer &lt;themselves&gt; to be intermixed, and in the fire they are mutually absorbed, according as &lt;there is&gt; only a difference of accidental quality &lt;between them&gt;.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						But what they assert reasoning from dissolution by fire needs no contradition, since copper whitened by tutia is very little discolored by fire.

				My notes:
			</h2>
			<p>
				To the real world, point 3 against alchemy may be incorrect (That isn't where metals are made). However, its reciprocal(point 3 for alchemy) is somehow worse? At least the understanding of anatomy is frankly astoundingly poor.
			</p>
			<p>
				Responses, point 1: "Natural bees and artificial bees generated from a decomposing bull are both bees." This astounded me when I first read it. However, after conspiring with others, there is a strange ammount of backing for this statement. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugonia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bugonia</a> involves the belief of bees from cow carcasses. This also may have been inspired by bee mimics that eat meat, or as Wikipedia points out, the behavior of some honey bees to build hives in skulls and carcasses if need be. Additonally, vulture bees eat meat, which could provide credence to the idea. Furthermore, the bible includes a story of bees within a dead lion. While today, this idea may seem to come out of nowhere, clearly there is actual backing for this idea, even without spontaneous generation.
			</p>
			<p>
				In theory, I could use Responses, point 3, to introduce cloning vats to the setting. However, at the same time, I almost don't want to give credence to that butchering of anatomy.
			</p>
			<p>
				In total, I think that, barring Responses, point 3, this is actually a strong argument for the Art, given the time period this was made.

				Newman explains the following materials:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							Green Salt: a variety of copper compounds
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Vitriol: copper or iron sulfate
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Tutia: zinc oxide (mined) or zinc carbonate (harvested from deposits formed on refineries)
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Sal ammoniac: ammonium chloride, found naturally, or as a product of decomposing hair</p>

                Metallina corpora utpote opera nature naturalina sunt, sed opera humana artificialia et non naturalina sunt.<br>
				Item singulorum metallorum componentia in quantitate determinata sunt, secundum quantitatem illiam quam mortales nesciunt. Igitur illia componere non possunt. Igitur illa componere non possunt.<br>
				Item locus nativitatis eorum est sinus terre ut locus fetus animalis est venter. Igitur sicut fetus non fit nisi in animalis ventre, ita nec metalla nisi in sinu terre.
				Item metalla tempus determinatum ut fiant habent, sed id ab hominibus ignoratur. Igitur et ea facere ignoratum est ab hominibus.<br>
				Item metalla specie differunt. Igitur sicut nec ab homine asinus nec ab homine asinus, sic nec ex metallis alia metalla fiunt.<br>
				Item fit quod eorum colores permutent, sed ignis illias permutationes dissolvit. Igitur frustrata mutata sunt.<br>
				Item philosophi si hanc artem veram esse ut ceteras scirent, ut ceteras eam docuissent.<br>
				Item sequaces eius nullum certum habent auctorem, sed cartas antiquas et fabulas facetas, verbit gratia: "retulit mihi quidam, 'accipe hoc et hoc, et adde hoc ad hoc, et fiet hoc ab hoc.'"<br>
				Item si esset ars vera, non adeo esset celata presertim tanto tempore, et tanta intentione quesita.<br>
				Imo opera humana cum naturalibus multimode eadem sunt, ut in igne et arre, aqua, terra, mineris, arboribus et bestiis ostendemus. Nam et ignis fulgoris naturalis et ignis de lapide eiectus uterque ignis est. Aer contines naturalis est et aer ex dec
