			<h1>Study of the Summa</h1>
			<p>
				In essence, Newman's study of the Summa begins at the start of European Alchemy. Newman first oulines the following points in the Avicennian portion of <a href="../Texts/deCongelatione.html"><i>De Congelatione</i></a>:
			</p>
			<h2>The basis of "Sciant Artifices"</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Artificial products are intrinsically both different and inferior from their Natural counterparts. The Art can mimic, but not surpass Nature.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Humans cannot know the true characteristics which seperate one species of metal from another, as these are buried beyond the reach of human senses.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>"Accidental" properties (physical characteristics which are not key to species) can be changed by humans with ease.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Metals are distinguished by the ratio of their components. As such, transmutation is only possible by transmuting the base components of the metal, which cn only be done if the metal is broken down to these components. Combining metals does not trigger this breakdown, but combines the "Accidental" properties</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Newman also points out that Aristotle's own stance on this was much weaker, pointing to the following excerpt:
			</p>
			<section class="Transcript">
				<p>
					One sort of art perfects that which nature cannot complete, wile another sort imitates nature.
				</p>
			</section>
			<p>My own take on this line is that there are various Arts. Some which can surpass nature, and others which cannot. This is a similar opinion to that of Paul of Taranto, as</p> MORE HERE LATER
			<p>This supposedly triggered a wave of "Neoplatonizing Aristotelianism"[1] (Deductive and Inductive reasoning to explain the world, with a mix of more mystical elements) within European Alchemists.</p>
			<p><br>While the Critical Edition's study of the Summa continues on in the history for a bit, that information is more integrated throughout my write-up of this research. Chapter 4, however, drags the camera back to Paul of Taranto, and the Summa.<br></p>
			<p>
				Paul's understanding of the Art splits it into two genera. The first of these is the basal elements, while the second is accidental properties. An example of the Art acting opon the second genus would be painting, sculpting, polishing, or otherwise manipulating something's physical properties without changing the underlying composition.
