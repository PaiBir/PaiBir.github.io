			<h2>Theophrasti Hohenheimensis</h2>
			<h3>Prologus</h3>
			<p>
				We are all familiar and well acquainted with the creation of all and every natural object that God has brought into existence. Every country has cognizance of its own, of what occurs and grows in it. Every man has cognizance of himself. Thus also an art and a craft have knowledge of their subjects. In such a way as cognizance is obtained of all creations that God has brought into existence, and nothing is concealed that man did not or would not know. That does not mean that all knowledge is in one, namely, that one man knew all this, buch each one his field. When they all come together, then everything is known. It does not mean either that every coutnry has knowledge of every other country, but each of its own, and when they are all taken together, then all is known. And every city, village, house, ect. has its own cognizance of all natural objects. And in the arts and crafts, all created objets are being used, one in this, one in that, and while they are all being used, we come to understand for what purpose that they have been created. And the final conclusion is that everything is subservient and subject to man. There are more things, however, than those which are comprehended and recognized in the light of nature, things which are above and superior to it. But these cannot be understood against the light of nature, that is in the light of nature, but in the light of man which is above the light of nature. There they may be understood. For nature emits a light by which may be percied from its own radiance. But in man there is also a light, outside the light born in nature. This is the light by which man hears, learns, and penetrates supernatural things. Those who search in the light of nature, talk of nature. Those who search in the light of man, talk of more than nature. For man is more than nature. He is nature. He is also a spirit. He is also an angel. He has the qualities of all these three. When he walks in nature, he serves nature. WHen he walks in the spirit, he serves the spirit. When he walks in the angel, he serves as an angel. The first is given the body, the others are given the soul and are its treasure. Since man has a soul and the other two, he elevates himself above nature, to explore also that which is not in nature, especially to learn about and explore hell, the devil, and his realm. In the same way man also explores the heaven and its essence, namely God and his realm. For he who must go to a place should know the character of the place in advance; then he will be able to travel wherever he pleases. Know therefore that the purpose of this book is to describe the creatures that are to be understood, what marvellous works God has created. For it is man's function to learn about things and not be blind about them. He has been equipped to talk about the marvellous works of God and to present them. It is possible for man to explore the essence and qualities of every single work that God has created. For nothing has been created that man could not explore, and it has been created so that man may not be idle but walk in the path of God, that is, in his works. Not in vice, not in fornication, not in gambling, not in drinking, not in plundering, not in the acquisition of goods nor in the accumulation of riches for the worms. But to apply his spirit, his light, his angelic kind to the contemplation of divine objects. There is more bliss in describing the nymphs than in describing metals. There is more bliss in describing the origin of the giants than in describing court etiquettes. There is more bliss in describing Melusine than in describing cavalry and artillery. There is more bliss in describing the mountain people underground than in describing fencing and service to ladies. For in these things the spirit is used to move into divine works, while in the other things the spirit is used to seek the world's manner and applause, in vanity and dishonesty. He who experiences and bears much on earth will also be learned in the resurrection while he who knows nothing, will be inferior. For there are many mansions in God's house and each one will find his mansion according to his learning. We are all learned but not equally, all wise but not equally, all skillful but not equally; he who searches deeply is most. For research and seeking experience thrive in God and avoid the vices of the world; they flee worldy service, obedience to princes, court manners, nice gestures; they learn tounges, in which are also lies and curses. But God's miraculous works - man's light learns them and does not ask tounges for it. Obedience to God, this is man's command. Obedience to men, what else is it than vain shadow? Man does not pay or obedience, has no reward for it. He dies, and when he is dead, he is dirt. What does man make of himself? He must learn more than obedience, and let obedience be, and love his neighbor; then obedience will come out by itself, as the flower and fruit come out of a good tree. Oh, how joyful is he who thinks in the following of his creator! He finds pearls that will not be thrown to the swine. But he who thinks in the following of man does not find anything or use. And so, know how to understand the beginning of this book. I am not writing about lovely matters and nice stories, but about supernatural matters that do not require nice stories, but let gossip be what it is.

			<h1>Liber Incipit Theophrasti</h1>
			<h2>Tractatus I</h2>
			<h3>Caput I</h3>
			<p>
				To begin with, it is only fair that I explain the subject about which I write hereafter, what it is all about. Know, therefore, that the purpose of this book is to describe the four kinds of spirit-men, namely, the water people, the mountain people, the fire people and the wind people. Included among these four kinds are the giants, the melusines, the Venusbery and what is similar to them. We consider them to be men, although not from Adam, but other creatures, apart from man and all other animals, in spite of the fact that they come from among us and children are born from them, although not of their own kind, but of our kind. How things are in relation to us will have to be described in the following order: First, their creation and what they are; second, their country and habitation, and where they stay and what their mode of living is; third, how they come to us and let themselves be seen, how they mix and have intercourse with us; fourth, how they perform some miraculous works, such as Melusine, the Venusberg and similar stories; firth, the birth of the giants and their origin, and also their vanishing and return.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is truth that a philosopher must build on the Holy Scriptures and take his arguments from them. But in the Scriptures nothing specieal is written baout these thingsl what to make of them or how to explore them. There are some remarks about the giants only. Although these things are treated outside of the Scriptures, their exploration is justified by the fact that they appear and exist. These things must be explored just like magic, if we are to belive in it - and we do and wish to ascetain its origin. The writers of the Bible and the New Testament discussed how the soul has to act towards God and God toward the soul, so that this philosophy may not fall back. But if we are permitted knowledge abuot the devil and about spirits and similar subjects, then this is something that has to be explored also, in regard to its nature. We have the power to travel in all the works of God, the physician in the natural remedy, the apostle in the apostolic remedy. For, as sick man a calls for a physician, things call for a philosopher, and a Christian for his Redeemer, and every work for his master. Such creatures are also necessary and also represent their condition, and they have not been created in vain. For, Samson was a man. Now he had strength over all men, which was not natural nor credible, and it resided in the hair; this is considered by men as superfluous and unneccesssary, but it has its reason why it must exist. David, who was a small man, killed the giant Goliath. It had to be, yet it did not seem humanly possible. Hence, nothing has been created that has not a mystery, and it may be a great one. In the Old Testament queer stories happen which nobody can interpret, and then the New Testament teaches him about them; how things are finally bound in a given place, why they occured and from what cause. Thus one learns that they occured indeed. The same applies to the things about which I write in the following - people find them unneccesssary and find that it is useless to talk about them. But since there is a reason for them which will be apperent, about which I shall write the sixth treatise, therefore it is not unneccesssary, but necessary to explore the things, and to include them in our philosophy and speculation, to contemplate these things together with others, what their final purpose is.

			<h3>Caput Secundum</h3>
			<h4>Spiritus Quid Et Anima; Item Spiritus Horum Caro Est Et Caro Spiritus; Exemplum Resurrectionis</h4>
			<h4>What are Spirits and Souls; Also this Spirit is Dear and Dear Spirits; Example of Resurrection</h4>
			<p>
				The flesh must be understood thus that there are two; the flesh from Adam and that which is not from Adam. The flesh from Adam is a course flesh, for it is earthen and is nothing else but a flesh that can be bound and grasped like wood or a stone. The other flesh which is not from Adam, is a subtile flesh, and can not be bound nor grasped, for it is not made from earth. Now, the flesh from Adam is the man from Adam. He is coarse like the earth which is compact. And therefore, man cannot go through a wall. He must make a hole to slp through, because nothing receeds before him. But before the flesh that is not from Adam, walls receed, which means that such flesh oes not require doors nor holes; it goes through intact walls and does not break anything. They are both flesh, bone, blood, and so on, whatever belongs to a man, and in their whole nature they are like man's. But they are different in that they have a double origin like two cousins; they are in equal way like a spirit and like man. The spirit goes through all walls and nothing locks him out; man, however, not, for h is locked out by the bolt or the lock. Just as you can distinguish and differentiate between a spirit and a man, so you shall recognize that people about whome I am writing but with the difference that they are seperated from the spirits by having blood, and flesh and bones. With all this, they bear children, talk and eat, drink and walk - things that spirits do not. Hence, they are like the spirits in speed, like man in gestures, figure, and eating, and so they are people who have the character of spirits and also that of man, and both are one in them.
			</p>
			<p>
				Although they are both spirit and man, yet they are neither one nor the other. They cannot be men, since they are spirit-like in their behavior. They cannot be sirits, sincey they eat and drink, have blood and flesh. Therefore, they are a creation of their own, outside of the two, but the kind of both, a mixture of both, like a composite remedy of two substances which is sour and sweet, and yet does not seem it, or two colors mixted together which became one and yet are two. It must be understood further that although they are spirit and man, yet they are neither. Man has a soul, the spirit not. The spirity has no soul, but the man has one. This creature, however, is both, but has no soul, and yet is not identicale with a spirit. For, the spirit does not die, but this creature dies. And so it is not like man, it has not the soul; it is a beast, yet higher than a beast. It dies like a beast and the animal body has no soul either, only man. That is why it is a beast. But they talk, laugh like man; this is why they are more like man than like beasts, but are neither man nor beast. They are to man like a monkey which is the animal resembling man most in gestures and actions. And as a pig has man's anatomy, being inside like man, yet a pig and not a man - in the same way these creatures are to man as monkeys and pigs, and yet better than they. For they are in everything like men, but without soul, that is who are from Adam, and not for those who are not from Adam, for they are men but have no soul. So much can be gathered from the Scriptures about them that they must be admitted to be men; but as far as the soul is concerned there is no knowledge of heir having one.
			</p>
			<p>
				Nobody should wonder that there are such creatures. For God is miraculous in his works which he often lets appear miraculously. For these things are not daily before our eyes but very rarely; And we see them only in order that we may know of theire existence, for they exist, and yet appear to us as in a dream. The great wisdom of God has decreed that we cannot be fathomed, nor can his great miraculous works be fathomed, not more than is needed to recognize our creator in his miraculous deeds.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, they are separated from us because they are not from Adam and do not participate in the same earth from which Adam was made, but God has decreed that we may see them miraculously, which has a particular meening, as will be discussed in the last tratise. They have children and their children are their kind, not ours. They are witty, rich, clever, poor, dumb, like are who are from Adam. They resemble us in every way. Just as one says: mas is the image of God, that is, he has been made after his image - in the samy way can one also say: these people are the image of man and made after his image. Now =, man is not God although he is made like him, but only as an image. The same here: they are not men because they are made after his image, but remain the same creatures as they have been created, just as man remains the same as God has created him. Thus he wants every creature to remain at the place where it has been created. And as man cannot bost that he is God, but a creation of God, thus made by God, and God wants it thus - in the same way these people cannot boast that they have a soul like man, although they look like him. Just as man cannot boast that he is God although he is made after him and he exists. Thus man lacks that he is not God. And the wild people lack the soul. Therefore they cannot say they are men. And so the one lacks God, the other soul. Thus God alone is God, and man alone is man.
			</p>
			<p>
				And so they are men and people, die with the beasts, walk with the spirits, eat and drink with men. That is: like the beasts they die, so that nothing is left; and neither water nor fire harms them, like the spirits, and nobody can lock them up, like the spirits, but they reproduce like men and therewith share his nature. They have man's diseas and his health but their medicine is not from the earth from which man is made, but from the element in which they live. They die like men, but are dead like the beasts. Their flesh rots like other flesh and their bones like other men's bones and nothing remains of it. Their customs and behavior are human, as is their way of talking, with all virtues, better and coarser, more subtile and rougher. The same applies to their figures: theyare very different, like men. In food they are like men, eat and enjoy the product of their labor, spin and weave their own clothing. They know how to make sue of things, have wisdom to govern, justice to preserve and protect. For although they are beasts, they have all the reason of man, except the soul. Therefore, they have not the judgement to serve God, to walk in his path, for they have not the soul. The beast from inborn nature seeks a just course towards itself, and so do they, bbut they have the highest reason, above all other animals. Just as man, above all creatures, is closest to God on earth in intelligence and faculties, so they are, among all animals, closest to man and so close that they are called people and men and are held and taken for such, so that there is no difference except in their spirit-like way and in the lack of soul - a queer and marvellous creature, to be considered above all others.

			<h2>Tractatus II</h2>
			<h3>About Their Abode</h3>
			<p>
				Their abode is of four kinda, namely, according to the four elements: one in the water, one in the air, one in the earth, one in the fire. Those in the water are nymphs, those in the air are sylphs, those in the earth are pygmies, those in the fire salamanders. These are not good names, but I use them nevertheless. The names have been given them by people who did not understand them. But since they designate the things and since they can be recognized by the names, I shall leave it at that. The name of the water people is also undina, and of the air people sylvestres, and of the mountain people gnomi, and of the fire people vulcani rather than salamandri. Whatever it may be, and however the differentiation may be understood, let it stay. Now you must know that if their region have to be described, they must be divided into parts. For the water people have no intercourse with the mountain people, nor the mountain people with them, nor the salamanders. Each has his special abode, but they appear to man, as mentioned, so that he may recognise and see how marvellous God is in his works, that he does not leave any element void and empty, without having great wonders in them. And now follow the four regions, which explains the difference of abode, also of person, essence, and kind, how far they differ from each, yet more similar to man than to each other, and yet all men, as was explained in the first treatise.
			</p>
			<p>
				You know that there are four elements: air, water, earth and fire; and you also know that we, men from Adam, stand and walk in air and are surrounded by it as a fish by water, and we can just as little be without it as a fish without water. As the fish has its abode in water, where water takes for it the place of the air in which it lives, so air takes for man the place of water, in relation to the fish. Thus everything has been created in its element, to walk therein. From this example you understand that the undinae have their abode in water, and the water is given to them as to us the air, and just as we are astonished that they should live in water, they are astonished about our being in the air. The same applies to the gnomi in the mountains: the earth is their air and is their chaos. For everything lives in chaos, walks and stands therein. Now, the earth is not more than mere chaos to the mountain manikins. For they walk through solid walls, through rocks and stones, like a spirit; this is why thee things are all mere chaos to them, that is, nothing. That amounts to: as little as we are hampered by the air, as little as they hampered by the mountain, by earth and rocks. And as it is easy for us to walk through air and air cannot stop us, so rocks and cliffs are easy to them. And so, things are all chaos to them which are not chaos to us. For a wall, a partition, stops us so that we cannot go through, but to them it is a chaos. That is why they walk through it; to them it is the air in which they live and walk, as man does in the air that is between heaven and earth. And the coarser the chaos, the more subtile the creature; and the more subtile the chaos the coarser the creature. The mountain people have a coarse chaos; therefore, they must be the more subtile; and man has a subtile chaos; therefore, he is all the coarser. And thus they are different kinds of chaos, and the inhabitants are adapted in nature and quality to live in them.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thus one wonder is explained, that of their abode, and you know know that their habitation in the four elements is their chaos, just as the air is for us, and there cannot be such accidents to them as drowning, or suffocating, or burning, for them the elements are nothing but air to the creatures who live in them. Since water is the fish's air, the fish does not drown, and so the unda does not drown either. As in the water, so in the earth: the earth is air to the gnomi; hence they do not suffocate. They do not require our air, we do not theirs. Thus also with the salamanders" fire is their air, as our air our air is. And the sylvestres are closest to us, for they too maintain themselves in our air, and they are exposed to the same kind of death as we, namrly: they burn in fire, and we too; they drown in water, and we oo; they suffocate in the earth, and we too. FOr, each remains healthy in his chaos; in the others he dies.
			</p>
			<p>
				Therefore, you must not be astonished about things that seam incredible to us; to God everything is possible. He has created all things for us, not according to our thoughts and intelligence, but above our throughts and intelligence. For, he wants to be looked upon as a God who is marvellous in his creations. Had nothing been created merely what is possible for man to believe, God would be all too weak, and man would be his equal. This is why he created things as a God, and let man marvel about them, and let his works be so big, that no one can marvel enough about these beings also. God wants to have it thus.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let us philosophize further, about their food. Know that each chaos has its two spheres, the heaven and the soul, just as we men walk on earth. Earth and heaven give us our food and the chaos is between the two. Thus we are nourished in between the two spheres and the globules. Thus also, those who live in the water, have the earth at the bottom, and the water as chaos, and the heaven down to water; and so they are inbetween heaven and earth and the water is their chaos. And their abode is according to their kind. Thus also with the gnomi, whose soil is water, and whose chaos is terra, and the heaven is their sphaera, that is, the earth stands in water. To them the earth is chaos and the water the soil. Food grows to them in such a way. The sylphhs are like men, nourish themselves like men in the wilderness, on herbs in the woods. To the salamanders the soil is earth, their heaven is the air, and fire is their chaos. Thus food grows to them from the earth and from fire, and the constelation from air is their heaven. Now, about the things they eat and drink, you may understand so much. Water quenches our thirst, but not that of the gnomi, nor the nymphs, nor of the other two. Further: if water has been created for us, to quench our thirst, then another water bust have been created for them, that we cannot see nor explore. Drink they must, but drink that which in their world is a drink. Each they must similarly, according to the contents of their world. One cannot find out more about these things, but only that their world has its own nature, just as ours has.
			</p>
			<p>
				About their clothing: they are clothed and cover their genitalia, but not in the way of our world, in their own way. For they have modestry and similar qualities, as men must have, and law and similar institutions, have their authorities, like the ants, which have their kind, and the wild geese which have their leader, not according to the laws of men, but according to their inborn nature. The animals have their hief, and so have they too, and more than all animals, because they are most similar to man. God has clothed all beings and endowed them with modestry, to walk and stand before man. To the beasts clothing is inborn by nature, but not to these people. To them noting is inborn by nature; they must work for it like man whom they resemble. Their work, like man's work, is in the nature and kind of their own world and earth on which they live. For he who gave us wool from sheep, gives it to them also. For it is possible for God to create not only the sheep which are known to us, but also the same in fire, in water, in the earth. For he clothes not only us, but also the gnomi, the nymphs, the salamanders, the sylvestres. They are all under the protection of God and are all clothed and guided by him. For God has not only the power to provide for man, but also for anything else, of which man knows nothing, and of which he becomes slowly aware. And when he sees and hears something, it is a miracle to him that bears no fruit, that is: he gives it no further thought, but remains obstinate and blind, like one who with good eyes has not the grace to see.
			</p>
			<p>
				About their day, night, sleeping and waking, know that they rest, sleep and are awake like men, that is, in the same measure as man. With that, they have the sun and firmament as well as we. That is: the mountain manikins have the earth which is their chaos. To them it is only an air and no earth as we have it. From this we must conclude tha they see through the earth, as we do the air, and that the sun shines to them through the earth, as it oes to us through the air, and that they have the same sun, the moon and the whole firmament in front of their eyes, as we men. To the undine the water is their chaos, and water does not keep them from the sun; and just as we have the sun through the air , they have it through the water, in the same measure. Thus also to the vulcans through the fire. And in the same way as the sun shines on us and fertilizes the earth, know that the same happens to them as to us. The consequence is, that they too have summer, winter, day and night, ect. But they do not need rain, snow, ect. They have it in a different way than we. These are the greater miracles of God. From all this we must conclude that they have pestilence, fevers, pleurises, and all diseases of the heaven, just as we do, and that they follow us in all these matters, since they are mean. But in the judgement of God, in the resurrection, they will be beasts and not men.
			</p>
			<p>
				About their figures, knot that they are different. The water people look like men, both women and men. The sylvestres do not conform, but are cruder, coarser, longer and stronger than both. The mountain people are small, of about two spans. The salamanders are long, narrow and lean. Their place and abode are in their chaos, as was mentioned before. The nymphs live in water, in running brooks, ect., so close that they grasp the people who ride through or bathe therein. The mountain people are in the mountaion chaos, and there they build their houses. This is why it often happens that one finds in the earth an attic, vaults, and similar structures, of the height of about a yard. They have been build by these people for their abode and dwellings. The water people do the same in their various places. Know also that the mountain people  people live in the caves of mountains and this is why strange structures occur and are found in such places. These are their work. Know also about the fire people whose yelling, hammering, and working can be heard in volcanic mountains. It can also be heard when the elements are incinerated. For all these things are the same with us, but according to their secret quality. Those who travel through wild reginos learn the reason for such beings and obtain information. There these beings are found. In the mines also, close to good ore, ect. they are found, and in waters the same also, and the vulcans near the Aetna. And there are many more marvellous things, about their coins, payments, and customs, which would be too long in this connection, but will be described in their place.
			</p>
			<h2>Tractatus III</h2>
			<h3>How They Come To Us And Become Visible To Us</h3>
			<p>
				All that God has created, he reveals to man and lets come before him, so that man has and attains knowledge of all happenings of the creatures. Thus God has revealed the Devil to man, so that man knows about the Devil, and he has presented the spirits and other matters still more impossible for men to perceive. The angels in the heaven he has also sent down to man, so that man may really see that God has angels who serve him. Such revelations do occur, but rarely, only as often as needed to believe and have faith in them. The same thing happens with the beings about whom I am writing here. They appear also. Not in order to have them all live or stay or mix with us, but God lets them wander to us and be with us as often as is needed for us to take cognizance of them and to know that God creates marvellous works. WHen he sends an angel to us, we learn that the Scriptures speak thruthfully of them; and once we know that of one thing, we know enough forever and ever, as long as the seed of man lasts, so that it is not neccessary to present things every day. And thus God has also presented these creatures to man, has allowed them to be seen, to deal with the people and talk, and so on, in order that man may know that there are such creatures as the four elements who miraculously appear before our eyes. And in order that we may have a good knowledge of things, the water people have not only been truly seen by man, but have married him and have born him children. Thus also, the mountain people have not only been seen, but people saw them, and talked to them, and recieved money from them and blows and similar things. The same happened with the forest people, as was mentioned before, the people saw them and dealt and walked with them. Thus also, with the vulcans, who also, as mentioned before, appeared to man, and revealed themselves essentially, who they were and what was to be understood of them all.
			</p>
			<p>
				And so many have been held before man that from them he may draw and take an adequate philosophy, to be explored adequately in the works of God, by the light of man which has been given to man alone, beyond all other creatures. For the like must be perceived by its like, that is, man is a spirit and a man, eternal and mortal. From this reasonably follows a knowledge of all the other things, namely, that he is one who has been created from God, after God. Thus man can not philosophize at any time about anything unless he has a subject from which his reasoning springs on which it is founded. If such a man is possessed by the evil spirit he must now, at any time, consider what this means. For nothing exists that remains concealed and is not revealed. Everything must come out, creature, nature, spirit, evil and good, outside and inside, and all arts, and all doctrines, teachings and what has been reated. Sometimes, such things become apparent only insofar as they are preserved in the memory of the people. They are still hiding and not generally known. It is not less true that man never becomes as apparent to others as these beings become apparent to man. The nymphs, namely, become apparent to us, but not we to them, except in what they tell us about their world, as a pilgrim would, who had been in foreign lands. They do not need such rapture, the way the mountain people entrapture us, or the water people. For they have no power over man, and their world is not such that they could adopt us. Man is not subtile in body, but coarse in body and subtile in chaos, while it is the contrary with them. Therefore, they can well stand our chaos, but not we theirs. Their element also is in itself their chaos, which to us may not be chaos. Thus they appear to us, stay with us, marry with us, die with us, and also bear children.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, the fact that they shall be revealed, is equal to a divine decree. God sends an angel to us, recommends his creature to him, and then takes him away again. And in the same way, these beings are presented sufficiently before our eyes. This happens with the water people. They come out o their waters to us, make themselves known, act and deal with us, go back to their water, come again - all this to allow man the contemplation of the divine works. Now, they are men, but on the animal side alone, without the soul. From this it follows that they marry men. A water woman takes a man from Adam, and keeps house for him, and gives birth to children. Of the children, we know that they follow after the father. Because the father is a man from Adam, a soul is given to the child, and it becomes like a regular man, who has an eternal soul. Furthermore, this also is well known and must be considered, that such women also recieve souls by becoming married, so that they are saved before Go and by God like other women. It has been experienced in many ways that they are not eternal, but when bound to men, they become eternal, that is, endowed with a soul like man. You must understand this in the following way: God has created them so much like man and so resembling him, that nothing could be more alive, and a wonder happened in that they had no soul. But when they enter into a union with man, then the union gives the soul. It is the same as with the union that man has with God and God with man, a union established by God, which makes it possible for us to enter the kingdom of God. If there were no such inion, of what would the soul be to us? Of none. But now there is the union with man, and therefore the soul is of use to man, who otherwise would have no purpose. This is demonstrated by them also: they have no soul, unless they enter into a union with men, and now they have a soul. They die, and nothing remains of them but the beast. And a man who is not in divine union is just like them. Just as the condition of these people is, when they are in union with man, so is the condition of man, when he is n union with God. And thus they emonstrate that they are beasts without man, and like them man without divine union is nothing. The union of two things with each other can achieve so much, that the inferior benefits from the superior and acquires its power.

				From this it follows that they woo man, and that they seek him assiduously and in secret. A heathen begs for baptism and woos it in order to acquire his soul and to become alive in Christ. In the same way, they seek love with man, so as to be in union with men. With them all intelligence and wisdom are outside the qualities of the soul, and not the soul. And so they recieve the soul, and their children also, by virtue of Adam's fruit, freedom and power, which holds and carries them to God. One must also think of what God will do with them in the end, since they are so close to man and must be consdiered as wild men; just as you say, the wolf is a wild dog, the ibex a wild he-goat and such like. One must also know that not all of them may be married to us. The water people come first; they are the closest to us. Next after them come the forest people, then the mountain and earth manikins who, however, rarely marry humans and are obliged to serve them. The vulcans never attempt to enter into union with humans, and yet are apt to serve them. Know also that two of them, namely the earth manikins and vulcans, are considered spirits and not creatures, bbeing looked upon as a mirage only, or as ghosts. You must know however, that just as they appear, thus they are, flesh and blood like another man, and with that, quick and fast like a spirit, as told in the beginning. They also know all future affairs, present affairs, and the past, which are not apparent but are hidden. In that they can serve man, protect, warn, guide him, and such like. For they have reason in common with man (except in regard to the soul). They have knowledge of the spirit (except in regard to God). Thus they are highly gifted, and they know and warn, so that man may learn about such things, and see them, and believe in such creatures. For this purpose God has let them appear to man, that he may seek knowledge and learn what God effects in such creatures.

				It is said of the nymphs, that they come to us from the water, and sit on the banks of the brooks where they have their abode, where they are seen, taken also, caught, and married, as we said before. The forest people, however, are coarser than they. They do not talk, that is, they cannot talk althought they have tounges and enough of all that is needed for speech. In this point they differ from the nymphs, for the nymphs can speak in the language of the countries; the forest people, however, cannot but they learn easily. The mountain manikins are endowed with speech like the nymphs, and the vulcans speak nothing, yet they can speak but roughly and rarely. The nymphs appear, as was saoid before, in human clothing, with human features and desires. The forest people people are like men, but shy and fugitive. The mountain people are like men, not tall, short; sometimes they reach about half the size of a man or so, sometimes more. Thus and in the same way, the vulcans appear, fiery, and fire is all over their features and clothing. They are the ones of whome says: a fire man or spirit is going through the house, there goes a burning soul, ect. It often happens that such figures ar seen. They also are the flames that are frequently observed as glowing lights in meadows and fields, runnings through each other and towards each other. These are the vulcans, but they are not found living with man, on account of their fire. They are often found with old women, however, that is, with witches, wooing them. One also must know that the devil takes possession of them just as he does of men, and thus goes around with them, appearing to the people in the features just mentioned. And this leads and brings them to the witches, and many such matters that happen when things are possessed by the devil, but it would be much too long to describe them here. You must know, however, that there is danger with the fire people, because they are commonly possessed, and the devil thus rages in them, which causes great harm to man. Know also that he equally takes possesion of the mountain people and makes them subservient to him, and the forest people also. He the can be found in the forest possessing sylphs and venturing to make love to women who live in forest regions. But they all become like lepers, scabby and mangy, and there is no help for them either.

				When these beings are not possessed by the devil they are human and seek union as has been mentioned. But they keep the way of spirits, in that they disappear. One who has a nymph for a wife, should not let her get close to any water, or should at least not offend her while they are one water. And one who has mountain manikin with him, should not offend him, particularly not at places where they get lost. But they are so much obliged to man and so closely bound to him, that they cannot get away from him, unless there is a reason for it, and this happens at the place from which they come. If one has a wife, she does not get away from him, unless she is provked while they are on the water. Otherwise she will not dissapear and can be held. The mountain manikins also must keep their pledges, when they are in service and have been pledged. But obligations to them must be kept also, in all that is due to them. If duties are kept as should be, they are honest, constant, and intent on their work. And one must know that they are particularly loyal to man and much inclined to spending money. For, the mountain people have money, because they themselves coin it. This is how it must be understood. What a spirit wishes to have, he has, and their wishing and desiring is this: when a mountain manikin wishes or desires a sum of money, if there is need for it, he has it, and it is good money. Thus they give money to many people in the galleries of mountains, to make them get away; they buy them off. All this is divine order - that they thus appear to us and that we see what is incredible to tell. Man is the most earthbound of all creatures. WHat he must have and wants, he must make for himself, and he obtains nothing by wishing and desiring it. But those people have what they need and desire, and man does nothing for it. They have it without work.

			<h2>Tractatus IV</h2>
			<p>
				As we came to the end of the treatise, we has sufficiently discussed the neccessities of these beings, and how they come to man. You must now, furthermore, know about their disappearance from man, and about their doings with us, with many such tales and stories that have happened with them, in many queer ways. And first about those who married men and bore them children, as was said before. When they have been provoked in any way by their husbands while they are on water, they simply drop into the water, and nobody can find them any more. To the hustband it is as if she were drowneed, for he will never see her again. And yet, although she dropped into the water, he may not consider her dead. She is alive and he may not take another wife. If he did, he would have to pay with his life and could never return to the world, for the marriage is not dissolved but is still valid. It is the same as in the case of a wife who has run away. She is not divorced from her husband, nor he from her. It still is a valid marriage that has not been dissolved and that nobody can ever dissolve, as long as there is life. When she has dropped into the water and has abandanded husband and children, her marriage is still valid, and she will present herself on the Day of Judgement on account of her union and pledge. The soul, namely, is not taken away nor seperated from her. She must follow the soul and hold to her pledge to the end. Although she remains a water woman and nymph, she must behave as the soul requires and the pledge she has given, except that she is separated from her husband, and that there is no return, unless he takes another wife. Then she returns and brings him death, as has happened many times.

				It also happens that sirens are born. They are water women too, but live more on the water than in it. They are not split like fish, but are more like a virgin, yet their form is not quite that of a women. They bear no children but are monsters, just as a strange human being can be born from any two normal parents. I would like to put this: the water people reproduce themselves like humans, but when it happens that they produce a monster, these monsters are sirens that swim on the water, for they repudiate themselves and do not keep them. This is why they occur in many forms and figures, as it happens and is the case with all monsters. Thus we marvel not only at the water people but also at the sirens, who have many strange features and are very different form people. SOme can sing, some can whistle with reeds, some can do this and that. Monks are also born from nymphs, that is, a monster which is shaped just like a monk. This you must know, namely, that such growths that are comparable to men and are founded in some lpaces, come from men, that is, they come from water people, earth manikins and similar beings. In order to understand the matter correctly, remember that God effects strange things in his creations. It is the same as with a comet. Born from other stars, the comet is nothing but a super-growth, that is, a growth that has not a natural course, as a star should have, but has been directed by God on purpose into another course. This is why the comet has great significance. And so have the sea wonders and similar things which thus come from water people. They too are such regular comets that God presents to man on purpose, not without meaning or significance. There is no need to write about it here, but this you must know, that great things come from such people, who should be great mirrors held before man's eyes. But love has cooled down in many, and thus they pay no attention to the signs, intent only on usury, self-interest, gambling, drinking, matters that are interpreted by these beings, as if they were saying: look at the monsters, thus you shall be after death; let yourself be warned, beware - but nothing is done about it.
