				We are all familiar and well acquainted with the creation of all and every natural object that God has brought into existence. Every country has cognizance of its own, of what occurs and grows in it. Every man has cognizance of himself. THus also an art and a craft have knowledge of their subjects. In such a way as cognizance is obtained of all creations that God has brought into existence, and nothing is concealed that man did not or would not know. THat does not mean that all knowledge is in one, namely, that one man knew all this, buch each one his field. When they all come together, then everything is known. It does not mean either that every coutnry has knowledge of every other country, but each of its own, and when they are all taken together, then all is known. And every city, village, house, ect. has its own cognizance of all natural objects. And in the arts and crafts, all created objets are being used, one in this, one in that, and while they are all being used, we come to understand for what purpose that they have been created. And the final conclusion is that everything is subservient and subject to man. There are more things, however, than those which are comprehended and recognized in the light of nature, things which are above and superior to it. But these cannot be understood against the light of nature, that is in the light of nature, but in the light of man which is above the light of nature. THere they may be undersood. For nature emits a light by which may be percied from its own radiance. But in man there is also a light, outside the light born in nature. THis is the light by which man hears, learns, and penetrates supernatural things. Those who search in the light of nature, talk of nature. Those who search in the light of man, talk of more than nature. For man is more than nature. He is nature. He is also a spirit. He is also an angel. He has the qualities of all these three. When he walks in nature, he serves nature. WHen he walks in the spirit, he serves the spirit. When he walks in the angel, he serves as an angel. The first is given the body, the others are given the soul and are its treasure. Since man has a soul and the other two, he elevates himself above nature, to explore also that which is not in nature, especially to learn about and explore hell, the devil, and his realm. In the same way man also explores the heaven and its essence, namely God and his realm. For he who must go to a place should know the character of the place in advance; then he will be able to travel wherever he pleases. Know thereforethat the purpose of this book is to describe the creatures that are to be understood, what marvellous works God has created. For it is man's function to learn about things and not be blind about them. He has been equipped to talk about the marvellous works of God and to present them. It is possible for man to explore the essence and qualities of every single work that God has created. For nothing has been created that man could not explore, and it has been created so that man may not be idle but walk in the path of God, that is, in his works. Not in vice, not in fornication, not in gambling, not in drinking, not in plundering, not in the acquisition of goods nor in the accumulation of riches for the worms.
