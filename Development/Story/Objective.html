				My view on Alchemy
			</h2>
			<p>
				The objective of any game using true historical events or ideas in a meaningful way should be to properly represent that event or idea. Alchemy is one such idea. While it would be easy to make some video game alchemy system, that is not the core of a setting in the making.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the center of my worldbuilding is alchemy, a topic I have grown increasingly familar with, namely in its actual execution. At its core, Alchemy is two things. First, it is a science, seeking to understand the composition of our world. But secondly, and more importantly for a story, it is an answer to an old question.
			</p>

				<h3>
					Can we hold dominion over Nature?
				</h3>
				<p>
					This is, in truth, a difficult question. Aristotle thought that we could, that one sort of creation could surpass nature. In the 13th century, alchemists thought we could, that Alchemy was the Art, the sort of creation, which controlled and surpassed nature. In the modern day, we think we do. That our cities and industry give us control over the natural world.<br><br>
					Avicenna thought that we couldn't, that our best attempts were mere immitations of what nature could do. In the medieval era, monks and farmers thought we couldn't, that such power was reserved for God. In the modern day, we see evidence that we don't, as wildfires, hurricanes, and earthquakes cripple towns and cities, even temporarily, and global warming looms as a seemingly near unquenchable threat.<br><br>
					This question is clearly still up for debate. But I think that Aristotle said it best.

						One sort of art perfects that which nature cannot complete, wile another sort imitates nature.

					Nature and Humanity both have their wonders. We cannot hope to match the awe and terror of a Supermassive Blackhole. We cannot currently match the power of the fusion reactor sustaining life on our planet. We can't yet produce structures of both size and beauty to nebulae. But, nature, so far as I know, has yet to create a story with the same endurance as the Hero's Journey. Nature, so far as I know, has yet to produce a location that inspires the same feelings as Cueva de las Manos. Nature, so far as I know, has yet to produce lessons in group cohesion on the same level as the fabels and stories we use to teach children.<br><br>
					Climate change is probably the best indicator of how we may influence nature, but by no means do we control it. We can change the planet at speeds little else can hope to. But the impact of that change is beyond our control. We can construct artificial islands, but we cannot control the impact on ocean currents. We can blast through mountains, but can only hope to catch the resulting rubble. We can construct vast monuments to show we were once here, but those that lasted were, from the outside, simple geometric shapes.<br><br>
					Alchemy is, at its very core, Aristotelian. However, I think the Platonism which found its way into Alchemy changed it. It inspired the desire to find the platonic art, the one true art, which could above all else, control nature. I do not personally believe in the search for that art, as with what we already can do without mastery over nature seems already like power beyond our station. If we cannot even predict the outcomes, or at least heed the predictions, associated with our actions, how can we expect to utilize true dominion over atoms, molecules, DNA, cells, lifeforms, biomes, continents, weather, planets, stars, solar systems, galaxies, universes? I personally am not a fan of the Kardashev scale, but if we aren't even a Type 1, and seemingly can't be trusted with our own abilities, how can we expect to safely use the abilities, of a type 3?<br><br>

			<h2>
				Media and messages
			</h2>
			<p>
				For a while I have been approaching games without a clear idea of the message I want to convey, and it has muddled my ideas derastically. However, it takes a truly special piece of media to be coherent, much less enjoyed, without a message. And a lasting piece of media will always have a message, even if assigned by the community.<br><br>
				If I want to make a <i>good</i> story. If I want to make a <i>clear</i> story. If I want to make a unified game, I need a message. Because while games are uniquely able to be more successful without a message, this only really applies to simpler games.

			<h2>
				My message
			</h2>
			<p>
				I believe that, if I am to make a setting which attempts to take Alchemy, and make it the core of the world of the game, I need to address the question which Alchemy tries to answer. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And I think there is only one answer I can give. That one sort of creation, that which is meant for humans, can surpass nature, while another sort, that which seeks to rule nature, can at best imitate.<br><br>
				The art, the acts of creation, which surpass nature aren't those which control it, but those that we give each other. Creations which are designed to move people will surpass nature, either by inspiring acts against instinct, or by teaching lessons which took generations to be learned.<br>
				The art, the acts of creation, which only immitate nature are those which try to control nature. Our houses are immitations of caves and our preferred conditions. But one bad storm will destroy them. Our neighborhoods are immitations of landscapes, but one forest fire can reduce them to rubble. If we ever achieve fusion, it will be an immitation of what our sun produces.<br>
