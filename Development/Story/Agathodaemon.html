                Agriwulf
            </h3>
            <p>
                Agriwulf is a former pirate turned Privateer for the Tribunal of Human Worlds at the start of the Great War (against the Forge of Prosperity). He was granted a pardon in return for his services, which he cautiously took.
            </p>
            <p>
                Agriwulf is a decently known and feared name, however that identity has started eroding since becoming a privateer. Agriwulf's ship is the Agathodaemon, named after a household god, and an old alchemist from an ancient story
            </p>

            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Agriwulf wants fame and fortune, simple as that. He used to be impoverished, but hedged his bets, and joined a pirate crew, quickly become a distinct personality with a tactical mind, and made a name for himself.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Agriwulf wants to quell the menace provided by the Forge of Prosperity, and protect his home in the process.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>
                Derecho
            </h3>
            <p>
                Derecho is a Sylph who works as the quartermaster of the Agathodaemon.  He is a former Sylphian Cosmonaut turned pirate to escape the regulations and punishments of the Sylphian Exploratory Military.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    As a deserter of the SEM, Derecho seeks to avoid capture and punishment. He supported the transition of the Agathodaemon from pirate to privateer in part for the legal immunities he gained against the SEM
                </li>
                <li>
                    Derecho wants to keep his freedom at all costs, and will fight to the death rather than risk loosing his freedom.

                Irkutsk
            </h3>
            <p>
                Irkutsk is a former Nymph mercenary who now works as a feeler for the Agathodaemon. Using contacts within both the Nerieds of the Cosmic Abyss and the Council of Potamides, Irkutsk provides Agriwulf with bounties and targets within the Agathodaemon's Letter of marque. Irkutsk is also a powerful solider, who at nearly all times wears a suit of body armor pressurized and filtered so that she can continue to breath properly in air-pressurized environments.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Goals:
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Irkutsk is solely in this business for the paycheck. Irkutsk has bargained up to 1 and quarter shares in return for her information. When the money dies down, she will leave the crew for clearer waters.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Irkutsk wants revenge on Nerieds of the Cosmic Abyss for kicking her out. She feels this happened unjustly, and seeks to regain her honor with a large enough bounty to make her name worth something.

                Caldera
            </h3>
            <p>
                Caldera is the chief mechanic on the Agathodaemon. While there is no fixed heigharchy, she is a dwarf with the most mechanical experience. This has afforded her significant sway with the crew and command, 
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Caldera is on the Agathodaemon to learn the secrets of TEMPLAR units. Due to the proximity of golems to earthborne spirits, she wishes to understand how they integrate with technology
                </li>
                <li>
                    Caldera is in a relationship with Miltiades, and cares deeply for his safety.

                The Vanguard are an elite force of raiders onboard the Agathodaemon. These are the best of the best.

                Travellers
            </h3>
            <p>
                Travelers is an Undine fugitive attempting to evade arrest by the Undine Collective. In joining the crew of the Agathodaemon, Travelers took on the identity of 'Tr-70', using a scrapped-together hydraulic and soft robotic exosuit as a false identity to evade suspicion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Travelers is an above-human intelligence, but not by much. It does give them superhuman reaction times and cognitive speed, turning them into a powerful Vanguard and Gunner.
            </p>
            <p>
                They is generally stationed near the boarding deck, to allow them to quickly run down there for a boarding action.

            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Travelers' goal is to find evidence of Universal Organism Theory, but unlike other Undine, is more receptive to using violence to accomplish this goal. Other Undine find this sacrilegious and disreputable, as such violence hurts the universe as a whole. Travelers finds that if an Undine or other organism can recover from large wounds, then the small amount of damage inflicted by Travelers is not only recoverable, but insignificant.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Until Tr-70 is outed at an Undine, Travelers is also attempting to hide the fact they are an Undine.

                Miltiades
            </h3>
            <p>
                Name meaning "Red Earth", and belonging to a former Greek general who beat the Persians, Miltiades is a valiant fighter and the partner of Caldera. He is most skilled with a RCS-supported heavy machine gun with full shield, built by Caldera specifically for him. Same goes for his custom armor.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Goals:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Miltiades' primary goal is getting back to Caldera at the end of every combat. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Miltiades wants to eventually marry Caldera, but the regulations and legal complexity of that is currently preventing this, especially given their questionable legal status as privateers
