                    The Salamander Military Mech "Man", also known as 'Cwingesynd', is a specialized unit that later goes into mass production
                </p>
                <p>
                    The unit is easily identified by its high heat output, paired with 2 pipes connected to its back, the middle one supplying burnable fuel for the reactor, and the sides supplying fresh water. Steam is lost from the engine. Cwingesynds can also be identified by the hybrid face, getting it the designation as a "man". Its jaws can open up, revealing an immitation human face.

                <p>
                    Cwingesynds consist of cable musculature, giving them more flexibility and forgiveness on armor plating, at the cost of speed (and lubricant), and thick ceramic armor, with a dense and heavy frame. While they do need to be actively fed, they do have a small window of operation once disconnected, however they get weaker as it progresses, until they drop unactive.
