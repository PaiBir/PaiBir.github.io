				<h1>Asher Griffiths, "Natural Philosopher"</h1>
				<p>My name is Asher Griffiths, and I am a college student persuing science communication surrounding the environment. With an interest in both the world around us, and how humanity has previously attempted to describe out world, I wish to bring back the idea of a "Natural Philospher". Natural Philosphers were not hermits in dank caves, performing occult rituals. Neither were they perfectly trained scientists with an absoulte understanding of the world around us. But what they were was even better. Individuals like Thomas Aquinas, Albertus Magnus, and Paulus of Taranto observed the world around them, and the works of other leading individuals, and used this to inform their faith. However, they also used their faith to inform their observations. This is something anyone can do, and everyone does do. However, we need to make this more conscious. We need to train the average citizen to be a "natural philosopher". We need to open up the tools and knowledge to let someone understand the world around them, their place in it, and give them the opprotunity to, on their terms, rationalize it against their values, faith, and background. Natural Philosophy is a term which is certainly doused in antiquity. However, we can bring it back, and in a form that is safe to both the individual and those around them, without restricting the individual from learning about the world around them.</p>
				<p>Since a young age, I have been fascinated by the world around us. Originally, the ocean was the focus of my research, however after an encounter with a Pileated Woodpecker in Black Hills Regional Park, I have been entranced by birds. Due to my love of talking and of documentaries, I now wish to use my knowledge to help inform others of the world around us, and how to research that world.</p>
				<p>In around November of 2025, I had an amazing opprotunity in a class to teach others about cartography, an art form I value highly. Thanks to great timing, and ideas I was already forming, I was able to approach this opprotunity not as a student with an assignment, but as an educator with a goal. I managed to inspire the two individuals I was working with to enjoy mapping, by getting them hands-on with the creation of the map, and the ideas for its form. Now, I seek to open up tools and opprotunities for others to be inspired, for the sake of understanding our world. One cannot fight for a world without understanding the world they fight for. That understanding need not be complete, but that is the value inherent in Natural Philosophy, a way of approaching the world which does not require a thorough understanding, so long as it is approached with an open mind.</p>

				<h1>The purpose of this site</h1>
				<p>This site contains both information about me, and the work I do, or plan to do.</p>
				<p>This site is a work ground, a massive canvas, where it will never truly be complete. However, that does not mean that their isn't value here.</p>
				<p>As I create tools, or understand works, they are placed upon the many pages of this site, with the goal of opening up access to those to find this place.</p>
